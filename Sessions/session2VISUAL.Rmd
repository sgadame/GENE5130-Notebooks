This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

First, we need to load the required libraries and import your counts data file:
```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(pheatmap)

# Import the counts table
# Assuming you have downloaded the file as "counts.txt"
counts_data <- read.table("counts.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Check the structure of the data
head(counts_data)
```

Question 1: Find the gene with the most counts across all samples
```{r}
# Use mutate to sum all counts per row
counts_summary <- counts_data %>%
  mutate(total_counts = rowSums(counts_data[, 7:ncol(counts_data)])) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_counts))

# Display the gene with the most counts
most_counts <- counts_summary[1, ]
print("Gene with the highest total counts:")
print(most_counts$Geneid)
print(paste("Total counts:", top_gene$total_counts))
```

Question 2: Find the length of the longest and shortest genes
```{r}
# Find the longest gene
longest_gene <- counts_data[which.max(counts_data$Length), ]
print("Longest gene:")
print(longest_gene$Geneid)
print(paste("Length:", longest_gene$Length, "bp"))

# Find the shortest gene
shortest_gene <- counts_data[which.min(counts_data$Length), ]
print("Shortest gene:")
print(shortest_gene$Geneid)
print(paste("Length:", shortest_gene$Length, "bp"))
```

Question 3: Plot a histogram of counts across all samples
```{r}
# Create a histogram of total counts
counts_histogram <- counts_summary %>% filter(total_counts > 0)
ggplot(counts_nonzero, aes(x = total_counts)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "blue") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Non-Zero Gene Counts",
       x = "Total Counts (log scale)",
       y = "Number of Genes") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
